# Survey-App-Backend

Welcome to the Survey API App! This application is a powerful and flexible tool built using Express.js and MongoDB,
enabling you to create and manage surveys efficiently. 
It is secured with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure data privacy and authentication.

## Introduction
The Survey API App provides a robust backend for creating, managing, and conducting surveys. With the power of Express.js, 
it ensures high performance and responsiveness. 
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used for efficient and flexible data storage, allowing you to handle large volumes of survey data with ease.
The app utilizes JWT for secure authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manipulate survey information.

## Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login with JWT authentication, keeping user data safe and preventing unauthorized access.

Survey Creation: Easily create multiple-choice surveys.

Survey Management: View, update, and delete surveys.

Response Collection: Collect and store responses from survey participants in the database.
